# ObjectDetection
A Python script that captures video from the webcam using OpenCV, performs real-time object detection with a pre-trained model (YOLO), and provides real-time audio feedback of detected objects using gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech). The script continues running until the user presses the 'q' key to exit.
